# Hey, I'm Bintang

## Who the Hell Am I?
I'm not your average code monkey. I write code for the thrill of breaking things, learning from the chaos, and, frankly, laughing at the absurdity of it all.

## What Do I Do?
I build, break, and rebuild code—sometimes with a side of AI experiments that may or may not work (but hey, that's half the fun). I'm here to challenge the status quo, push boundaries, and toss aside any notion of perfection that mainstream tech drivel forces on us.

## Random Bullshit
Got a wild idea or just some off-the-cuff ramblings? I'm all in. Whether it's debating the latest tech trends or just venting about life's random absurdities, I'm not here to sugarcoat anything. Expect raw, unfiltered, and sometimes downright rude musings. If you're easily offended, tough luck—this space isn't for the delicate.

## Hit Me Up
Think you can dish out some honest, unfiltered banter? Or got a crazy idea that deserves a rant? Drop me a line. I won't hold your hand, but I'll give you a piece of my mind if you earn it. Welcome to the madhouse.
